# Ex-7 - Implement DES Encryption and Decryption

## Aim:
  To use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm for a practical application like URL Encryption.

## ALGORITHM: 
  1. AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution–permutation. 
  2. AES does not use a Feistel network like DES, it uses variant of Rijndael. 
  3. It has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. 
  4. AES operates on a 4 × 4 column-major order array of bytes, termed the state
